# 📈 Venture Capital SQL Analysis: Strategy & Trend Reporting

## 🎯 Project Goal: Uncovering Data-Driven Investment Strategy

This project served as a comprehensive SQL assessment focused on extracting, transforming, and analyzing over **40,000+ records** of startup funding, acquisition, and company data. The primary objective was to answer strategic questions from Venture Capital (VC) stakeholders related to market landscape, acquisition trends, fund activity, and risk analysis.

## 🔑 Key Technical Achievements

The project's value lies in demonstrating proficiency with **advanced SQL concepts** required to synthesize actionable business intelligence.

* **Fund Activity Classification (CASE Logic):** Created conditional fields (`high_activity`, `middle_activity`, `low_activity`) using **CASE statements** to categorize fund behavior (Queries 8, 9).
* **Volatile Market Analysis (HAVING):** Identified market volatility by calculating the highest and lowest funding amounts per day, using the **HAVING clause** to filter on aggregated data (Query 7).
* **Complex Multi-Table Analysis (Subqueries & Joins):** Executed advanced analysis combining multiple tables with **INNER JOINs and Subqueries** to investigate the correlation between employee education levels and startup failure rates (Query 10).
* **Acquisition & Risk Trend Analysis:** Calculated total cash acquisitions during a specific economic recovery period (2011-2013) to benchmark financial trends (Query 3).
